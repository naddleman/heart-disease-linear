Several analytic techniques will be employed but first, a basic linear model

## Basic functions only!

The Right way to do this is to use something like scikit-learn. This project
deliberately avoids that to emphasize the underlying mathematics & procedural
steps sophisticated libraries automatically perform. It's an educational 
exercise.
